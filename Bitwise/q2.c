/*Write a program in which define a as an unsigned integer whose value is (hexadecimal)
0xa2c3. Write the corresponding bit pattern for this value. Then evaluate each of the
following bitwise expressions, first showing the resulting bit pattern and then the
equivalent hexadecimal value. Utilize the original value of a in each expression. Assume that
a is stored in a 16-bit word
1. ~a
2. a ^ 0x3f06
3. a | 0x3f06
4. a | ~0x3f06
5. a >> 3
6. a << 5
7. a ^ ~a
8. a | ~a
9. (a & ~0x3f06) << 8
10. a & ~ (0x3f06 >> 8*/
